Burining a single rope lets you measure 1 hour. Burning 2 ends of it at the same time let you measure 30 minutes.
Start by lighting both ends of one rope and only one end of the second rope. When the first rope is finished burning
(i.e., after a half an hour), light the other end of the second rope. At this point, the second rope is halfway burned, 
so it will take another 15 minutes to burn the second half with both ends lit. When the second rope is done burning, 45 minutes has elapsed.
15 minutes has elapsed after first rope is completely burnt.
