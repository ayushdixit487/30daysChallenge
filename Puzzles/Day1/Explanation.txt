Ans:  N-1;

Explanation:

Example:
N = 6

5 couples are invited to the dinner. Among the total six couples, no one shook more than 10 hands.
Therefore, if eleven people each shake a different number of hands, the numbers must be 0, 1, 2, â€¦, and 10.
The person who shook 10 hands has to be married to the person who shook 0 hands (otherwise that person could have shaken only ten hands).
Similarly, the person who shook nine hands is bound to be married to the person who shook 1 hand.
Continuing the logic, couples shook hands in pairs as mentioned 10/0, 9/1, 8/2, 7/3, 6/4. The only person left who shook hands with 5 is the hostess.
